1,1.1,Response Format Inconsistency,MEDIUM,"app/api/auth/*, app/api/user/*, app/api/quiz/*","No standardized response structure across API endpoints. Patterns range from good (Pattern A) to broken (Pattern C with 'as any'). Clients must handle multiple formats.","1.2,1.4"
1,1.2,Hard-coded Bearer Token in /api/user/profile,CRITICAL,"app/api/user/profile/route.ts:7,54","Production code contains hard-coded test Bearer token 'Bearer expired-token'. Returns mock test data unrelated to caller. Not using middleware auth.","1.1,1.4,1.5"
1,1.3,Authentication Fragmentation (NextAuth + Firebase + Bearer),HIGH,"app/api/auth/register, app/api/auth/login, app/api/user/profile, app/api/user/stats","Three different auth systems active simultaneously.

1,1.4,Input Validation Inconsistency,HIGH,"app/api/auth/*, app/api/user/profile, app/api/daily-quiz, app/api/quizzes","Some routes use Zod + sanitization (good). Others use manual checks or no validation. Some expose validation errors. No centralized validation middleware.","1.1,1.2"
1,1.5,Error Handling Patterns Inconsistent,HIGH,"app/api/auth/register, app/api/auth/session, app/api/daily-quiz","Multiple error response formats. Some routes expose internal details (security risk). No correlation IDs for debugging. Inconsistent HTTP status codes.","1.1,1.3"

Public/user endpoints unprotected from DoS and scraping attacks.","None"
1,1.7,Request Tracing & Observability Gaps,MEDIUM,"All API routes except /api/auth/*","Only auth endpoints generate request IDs. Other routes lack tracing capability. Hard to trace requests through logs for debugging.","1.4,1.5"

1,1.10,No Standard Response Format,CRITICAL,"All API routes","Clients must handle Pattern A (good), Pattern B (problematic), Pattern C (broken with 'as any'), and Pattern D (raw data). Makes error handling fragile and API unpredictable.","1.1,1.2,1.4,1.5"
2,2.1,Provider Nesting Complexity,HIGH,"app/layout.tsx:317-330","5 nested providers (SessionProvider > ReactQueryProvider > ResponsiveUIProvider > FirebaseProvider > PerformanceProvider).

Time-on-screen recorded under MetricType.COMPONENT mixing semantics. Actual render duration never captured. 'Slowest components' is misleading.","None"
4,4.9,Redundant Monitoring Systems,MEDIUM,"performanceAnalyzer.ts, performanceMonitor.ts, socialPerformanceMonitor.ts","Three separate metric collection systems identical in structure. Each has 1000 metric max. 3x memory overhead. Inconsistent metrics. Maintenance burden (changes in 3 places). Confusing which to use where.","4.1"
